#### I'm currently working on: 
- <a href='https://objectobject.co'>[object Object]</a> - an alternative to StackOverflow.
- <a href='https://gpt-4.co'>GPT-4</a> is basically a "dead" project (it was released to a limited amount of friends \[and some other places ðŸ˜‰], but is constantly used by me internally). In short, GPT-4 was GPT-3 but _good_, and one of my first projects made to compete with OpenAI. 
- <a href='https://bysourfruit.com'>bysourfruit</a> is a webpage made to allow the general public easy access to my projects.
- (no link) SourfruitHW - a set of hardware kits made to make building robots easier.
- bunch of other stuff

### Regarding my GitHub... 
I've kind of just decided to ignore its main use case, being a perfect platform to showcase projects/code. In 2022, I deleted even more things from GitHub- including repositories, organisations, etc. Now, almost everything sits on a NAS, and GitHub is just another social profile I sometimes maintain. 

Eventually, I might just upload _parts_ of projects onto GitHub, (e.g) Takeout, TrackerKit, GPT-4, SourfruitHW, etc. These projects might also just appear in an organisation.

With that being said, any large/interesting/'I felt like showcasing it' projects will appear on [def-not-hacking-the.net](https://def-not-hacking-the.net) and [*.bysourfruit.com](https://bysourfruit.com)  

<b>You can find me on Twitter (<a href='https://twitter.com/s0urfruit'>@s0urfruit</a>)</b>
